# Git Is: 
---
+ a version-control system, maybe the most popular one worlwide;
+ which allows multiple devs to view, apply, and remove changes to the same code;
+ without making unwanted or untimely changes to each others code;
+ while storing a history of code changes;
+ and minimizing the possibilty of irreparable damage to or loss of the code;
+ all the while keeping all of a project's files in one directory; 
+ making (to continue beating the dead horse) collaboration possible. 

# Git Terminal Commands (short list):
---
+ Cloining: git clone https://example.example | pulls a respository from a server into your local environment.
+ File status: git status | indicates the repos's relevant branch and the file's status (tracked, modified, or untracked).
---
+ Track (or add) one file: git add filename.
+ Track (or add) all files: git add . (per Roger) or git add * (per Udemy).
+ Commit a file: git commit -m "Specific description of the change you made."
+ Commit all changes: git commit -a | commits a snapshot of all modifications to tracked files in the working directory. 
+ Push a repo to the server (GitHub): git push origin master.
+ Pull a repo from the server: git pull origin master. 
---
+ Stash changes: git stash | saves changes without committing them. 
+ Continue working on these changes: git stash apply | to retrieve these uncommitted changes.
