  + Code editors are used to write, review, and edit code.
  + This terminology is often used interchangeably.

+ How to Choose a Code Editor
  + Somewhat of an arbitrary or personal choice, if not working alone, choose the one most widely used at your school or place of work.
  + Because all text editors contain the same functions, more or less, it may not matter much, in the end, which editor you choose.
  + In the end, the best text editor for you will meet the following two criteria: 
    1. It serves every need you, as a developer, have;
    2. You enjoy using it. 

+ The Most Important Features of a Good Code Editor, per [The Older Coder](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, are the following: 
  1. dode completion;
  2. syntax highlighting;
  3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue);
  4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
