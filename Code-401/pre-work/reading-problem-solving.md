# Code 401 | Problem Solving

## Class 01 Reading Notes

### ["How to Solve Programming Problems"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

I. Read the problem completely twice: The goal is to ensure that you understand the problem before beginning; if you can explain it to someone else, then you understand it.

II. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

- "Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually."
- Solve your problem with at least three different inputs = testing. 

III. Optimize the manual steps.

- This is like refactoring before you actually get to writing code.
- Apparently, it's easier at this phase than after the code is written.

IV. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

- This step can be skipped, if your last step has already got you there, but it's recommended for those who are learning and/or struggling.
- Put your comments into your editor, so that you'll have steps to follow as you write your code.

V. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code: if you've done the above steps, this one will be easy, requiring no problem solving.

- If you're struggling with this step, you either skipped or skimped on the steps above or you need more practice in your target language.

- Here are some basic things you should be able to do in your target language:

  - Create a list;
  - Sort a list or array;
  - Create a map or dictionary;
  - Loop through a list or dictionary;
  - Parse strings;
  - Convert from string to integer, integer to string, etc.;

VI. Optimize the real code.

- Refactor where appropriate/possible.
- Ensure that you've used meaningful nomenclature.

### ["Pretend Your Time Is Worth $1,000/Hour and You'll Become 100x More Productive](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)

- "If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month." Being focused is what this article recommends.

- "Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time. This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time."

- "If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such."

- "Years later, I finally began seeing my time as very important. I began saying “no” to almost everything. I had a mission, and I became unwilling to fill my valuable time with things that wouldn’t help me achieve my goal."

- "Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things."

- My takeaways:

  - This guy doesn't write, he collects quotes and retools them.
  - If this is his mission, then no wonder he found it: it's easy.
  - I lack a sense of purpose, a mission. And I admint, I feel desperate and will feel lucky if/when someone hires me to write code. I wish there'd been more info on how to go about finding one's mission.
  - Lastly, I consider sacred the providing and caring for one's family.

### ["How to Think Like a Programmer -- Lessons in Problem Solving"]{https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

I. The wrong way.

- Try a solution.
- If that doesn’t work, try another one.
- If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

II. The right way: have a framework and practice it.

- "Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job."
- "The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems."

III. The steps

- Understand the problem: you know a problem when you can explain it in plain language.

- Plan your solution: "Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps. . . . Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

- Divide big problems up into bite-sized ones.

IV. What to do when you're stuck

- "\[T]he best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated."

- Three things to try:

  - "Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does)." What did you actually tell your program to do?
  - "Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?"
  - "Sidenote: Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is."
  - Research. But don't look for solutions to the whole problem, but rather to the sub-problems that make it up.

V. Practice

  - coding challenges (the author recommends coderbyte).
  - video games (the author suggests that well-known, successful business folk use/d video games to develop their problem-solving skills, though probably not with that intent).

### ["5 Whys: Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly"](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

I. Background: based on Toyota's founder's 1930s technique for solving problems.

II. The core of the technique: "when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring."

III. How to use it

- Assemble a team: these members should be intimately familiar with the problem at hand.

- Define the problem (if possible, after observing the problem in action).

- Ask the first "why?": search for answers that are grounded in fact.

- Ask "why?" four more times: "Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded."

- Know when to stop: "You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further."

- Address the root causes: enter counter-measure.

- Monitor your measures: amend as necessary.
