# Code 401 | Gatsby, Next.js, and other JS Frameworks

## Class 43 Reading Notes

I. Research Questions

- What does React Native do when it builds your application?: "React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via Reactâ€™s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript" ([React Docs](https://reactnative.dev/))

- Can you simply deploy a react web app to the phone?: Nope. You've got to refactor it using React Native.

II. Vocabulary

- Eject: Not sure, but has something to do with create-react-native-app and simply initializing the app using react-native init.

- Android avd: "An Android Virtual Device (AVD) is a configuration that defines the characteristics of an Android phone, tablet, Wear OS, Android TV, or Automotive OS device that you want to simulate in the Android Emulator. The AVD Manager is an interface you can launch from Android Studio that helps you create and manage AVDs" (developer.android.com).

- Expo: "Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase" (["Introduction to Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)).
