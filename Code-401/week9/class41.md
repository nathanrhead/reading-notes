## Class 41 Reading Notes

I. Research Questions

- Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”:
  - The Redux Toolkit is meant to provide code out of the box for standard use cases, thus simplifying the most familiar tasks.
  - A duck is a folder in which everything pertaining to redux is kept, with each aspect of redux housed in one file--i.e., actions.js, index.js, operations.js, reducers.js, selectors.js, tests.js, types.js, utils.js. (["Scaling Your Redux App with Ducks"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be/)).

- What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?: It simplifies the setup of Redux, and reduces the number of libraries and boilerplate code required to support Redux. (["Why You Should Use Redux Toolkit Library?"](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/why-you-should-use-redux-toolkit-2b73a8e2f75a).

II. Vocabulary

- Redux toolkit slices: A slice is a set of reducer logic and related actions for a single feature. A toolkit slice is an abstracted method for making slices using the "createSlice" function, which "accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state" (["Redux Toolkit createSlice"](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice)).

- Namespace: in React, a parent component to which belong child components, like a burger and its constituent parts. ["ReactJS components with namespace"](https://medium.com/@kunukn_95852/react-components-with-namespace-f3d169feaf91)
