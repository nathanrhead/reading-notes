- ["The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (Short Version)"](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/)

## PREAMBLE

The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of the abstraction; the clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.

Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:

1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

1. Ethics in the Workplace

- ["The Code I’m Still Ashamed Of"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

- ["The employee backlash over Google’s censored search engine for China, explained"](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17704526/google-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-china)

```
It must seem strange for executives to be forced to consider their employees' wishes when making decisions about which direction to take a company. Irkisome, even. In a country where success is defined by the bottom line of a quarterly ledger and freedom by the right of individuals to speak their minds, I imagine these executives, if they don't privately agree with their employees' ethics, are privately cursing them for making their jobs harder. I am impressed that the voices, in this case, of a very small percentage of employees at Google, translated into the eventual dropping of the Dragonfly project approximately a year after the publishing of this article. I'm hesitant, however, to place a lot of the credit at the feet of these employees because, while I agree that they add the real value for stakeholders, being the creators of the products being sold, executives no that they are reaplaceable, that new engineers can be found willing to do the dirty work. I'm more inclined, given the amount of time that elapsed between the leak of information regarding the project and its cancellation, to believe that the cost-benefit analysis for the project proved sour. Perhaps the public-relations fallout tipped the scales. I do hope, though, that Google and other gargantuan companies like it take stock of the power they hold and take steps to let their employees be their conscience.

```
As with water, fire, and ice, everything in the world has the potential to benefit or to harm us and is likely doing both of those things simultaneously somewhere. Should I be surprised that big data is no exception? No. Should I be concerned about the harm it can inflict in the hands of the wrong people? Yes. Because people will act first-and-foremost selfishly, the wrong people are those who stand to benefit from the misuse of big data, including the companies who mine it professionally and the organizations that consume it, including the government, advertisers, banks, insurance companies, and search engines. It is disconcernting to consider the implications for identification and discrimination that big data carries, and I'll plan to keep my ear to the ground in this regard, now that I'm a member of the tech community with a responsibility for ethical behavior.
