# Code 401 | Component Based UI

## Class 26 Reading Notes

I. Research

- Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

  1. AngularJS: "AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications" (Wikipedia).
  2. Vue.js: "Vue.js is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members" (Wikipedia)>
  3. Svelte: "Svelte is a free and open-source front end JavaScript framework created by Rich Harris and maintained by Harris and other Svelte core team members. Svelte applications do not include framework references" (Wikipedia).
  4. Bootstrap: "Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components" (Wikipedia).
  5. Next.js: "Next.js is an open-source React front-end development web framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications" (Wikipedia).

- What’s the difference between a framework and a library? (Answers are from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/)):

  - "Both frameworks and libraries are code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems."
  - "The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control.When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed."
  - Example: jQuery is a library while React is a framework.

II. Vocabulary

- Rendering: the process of displaying something on a screen.

- Templates: "JavaScript templating refers to the client side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language. This approach became popular thanks to JavaScript's increased use, its increase in client processing capabilities, and the trend to outsource computations to the client's web browser. Popular JavaScript templating libraries are AngularJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js, Handlebars.js, Vue.js and Mustache.js. A frequent practice is to use double curly brackets (i.e. {{key}}) to call values of the given key from data files, often JSON objects" (medium.com).

- State: "State describes the status of the entire program or an individual object. It could be text, a number, a boolean, or another data type. It’s a common tool for coordinating code" ([freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/state-in-javascript-explained-by-cooking-a-simple-meal-2baf10a787ee/#:~:text=State%20describes%20the%20status%20of,instantly%20react%20to%20that%20change)).
