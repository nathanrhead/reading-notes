# Code 401 | Props and State

## Class 27 Reading Notes

I. Research Questions

A. Does a deployed React application require a server?: Yes. (No? Maybe?)

B. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior level rather than the unit level?: because testing for the right outcome given certain user behaviors yields a more accurate picture of the code's state than does testing to see whether a piece of code is doing a thing on the way to reaching the desired outcome.

C. What does npm run build do?: "npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file" ([Create-React-App.dev](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)).

D. Describe the actual composition and architecture of a React application:

II. Vocabulary

- BDD: behavior-driven development = developing based on what a user will be doing on a site and testing for expected results of that behavior (click, input, etc.).

- Acceptance Tests: "An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario. ... Similar to a unit test, an acceptance test generally has a binary result, pass or fail" (agileallegiance.org).

- Mounting: "Mounting is a process by which the operating system makes files and directories on a storage device (such as hard drive, CD-ROM, or network share) available for users to access via the computer's file system" (wikipedia.org).

- Build: "In a programming context, a build is a version of a program. As a rule, a build is a pre-release version and as such is identified by a build number, rather than by a release number. ... As a verb, to build can mean either to write code or to put individual coded components of a program together" (SearchSoftwareQuality.TechTarget.com).
