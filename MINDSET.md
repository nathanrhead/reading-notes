> As the boss baby says in the eponymous film, "Whether you believe you will succeed or not, you're right."  

> The empowering aspect of a growth mindset lies in this first-person theory, that you determine your limitations, that by dint of hardwork and dedication, you may become whomever you want.  

> The only thing lacking in your efforts to improve your station or develop your ideas or grow in strength, wisdom, and influence is a belief in your ability to accomplish whatever you've set your mind to, if only you're willing to work for it.

> A powerful serve is the product of practice and the belief that perfection is worth chasing and is within reach.
