III. How the web works

    A. "When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP)."
    B. "Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer."
    C. "The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users."
    D. "The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser."

    B. <head>: metadata for the browser
        i. Comes before the body;
        ii. Contains info about the page, e.g. <title>, which will display a title on the tab of the page.    

### HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (pages 176 - 199)

    B. XHTML 1.0: released in 2000: a mix of HTML and XML
    C. HTML5: released in 2000
    D. "Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using." 
    E. "Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. . . . As you will see when you come to look at CSS in the next section, giving an element a unique identity allows you to style it differently than any other instance of the same element on the page."
    
II. How to add comments to your code: <!-- comments -->

III. Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on any element

    A. "ID attributes can be used to allow JavaScript to work with that particular element."
