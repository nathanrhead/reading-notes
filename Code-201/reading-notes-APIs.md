### Chapter 9: "APIs" (pp. 409 - 448)

I. Introduction

  A. Definition: Application Programming Interfaces: allow programs, incluidng scripts, to talk to each other.

  B. Browsers, scripts, websites, and other applications frequently open up some of their functionality so that programmers can interact with them.
  
    1. Browsers: "The DOM is an APL lt allows scripts to access and update the contents of a web page while loaded in the browser."
    2. Scripts: "jQuery is a JavaScript file with an APL It allows you to select elements, then use its methods to work with those elements."
    3. Platforms: "Sites such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter open up their platforms so that you . can access and update data they store (via websites and apps). In this chapter you see how Google lets you to add their maps to your sites."

II. What the API can do: you don't have to know how it works, you only have to know how to make it work.

  A. Examples of APIs
  
    1. "The DOM and jQuery APIs allow you to access and update a web page that is loaded in the browser and respond to events. 
    2. FB and Twiiter, for example, "let you access and update profiles and create status updates on their platforms."

  B. How to access APIs

    1. DOM: it's "built into the JavaScript interpreter in the browser."
    2. jQuery: "you need to include the jQuery script from your server or a CDN in your pages."
    3. "Facebook, Google+ [now defunct], Twitter, and other sites provide various ways to access the functionality of their platforms using APls."

  C. The syntax: "you need to learn how to ask the A PI to do something and the format in which you should expect any replies. As long as you know how to call a function, create an object, and access the properties and methods of an object, you will be able to use any JavaScript API."
