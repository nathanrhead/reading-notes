I. Order of execution: how scripts are processed

  A. Execution contextsJ

    1. Execution context: "Every statement in a script lives in one of three execution contexts."

      a. Global context: "Code that is in the script, but not in a function."
      b. Function context:"Code that is being run within a function. Each function has its own function context."
      c. Eval context (not shown): "Text [that] is executed like code in an internal function called eval()."

    2. Variable scope: "The first two execution contexts correspond with the notion of scope."

      a. Global scope: "If a variable is declared outside a function, it can be used anywhere because it has global scope. If you do not use the var keyword when creating a variable, it is placed in global scope."
      b. Function-level scope: "When a variable is declared within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is because it has function-level scope."
